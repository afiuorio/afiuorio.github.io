I'm a MSc. student in Computer Science. I mainly work on programming languages development and cryptography but I'm an "all around" computer scientist and developer. I like the concept of solving problems in an efficient way using a machine and I'm quite interested in "low-level development": computers are complex machines and I want to handle the "complex" part for making them easier to use.

* In 2014 I've participated to the [Google Summer Of Code](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/panzone/5717271485874176) under the [Mono Project](http://www.mono-project.com/community/google-summer-of-code/), working on SGen, their garbage collector.

* In 2015 I've obtained my BSc. in Computer Science with the thesis *Portable and modular exceptions in Neverlang2*.

* In 2016 I've participated to the [Google Summer Of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6738560711393280) under the [Chapel programming language](http://chapel.cray.com), working on several improvements on the language's compiler and runtime.

* Currently I'm collaborating with the [Cryptography and Coding Laboratory](http://www.club.di.unimi.it), working on key derivation functions and video streaming encryption.
