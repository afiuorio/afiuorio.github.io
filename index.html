    <p align="justify">I'm both a computer scientist and a software developer. I mainly work on programming languages development,
    cryptography and system administration but I'm an "all around" computer scientist and developer. I like the concept of solving
    problems in an efficient way using a machine and I'm quite interested in "low-level development":
    computers are complex machines and I want to handle the "complex" part for making them easier to use.</p>
